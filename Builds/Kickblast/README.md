PROTOTYPES

Hello! Thanks for your interest in Puremagnetik Prototypes.

These are small, experimental sketches that are built as alpha, proof-of-concept distributions.

I do not provide installers or support for them but I will make an effort to reply to questions on IG or Github Issues.

For the most part, they should function as expected as I've tested them on my own systems.

Nevertheless, I hope you enjoy them and can make something cool with these sketches.

To install for OSX:
Move the VST and/or Component files to their respective folders
Macintosh HD/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/Components

to install for Windows:
I built an installer. Just run it and point it to your plugin directory

Thanks and have fun!
